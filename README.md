# RITSEC Site Web and Mobile Project 3
This is the current website we are using for [www.ritsec.club](https://www.ritsec.club)

I have edited the sponsorship opportunities page to make it more asethically pleasing. You can find my version here: https://littlehack3r.github.io/sponsoroffer.html

It uses Jekyll to compile the website to a static site as we don't require any dynamic content still benefit from easy editing.  This was created from inspiration of [CSH's Website](https://www.csh.rit.edu/) which was used as the base template and modified to be a Jekyll site.
